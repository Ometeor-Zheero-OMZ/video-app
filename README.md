# Understanding OpenGL and FFmpeg

Most of the code is provided by Bartholomew.
Thanks a million! 

Yet, I'n not intending to improve this project.
Rather, my goal is understanding FFmpeg and video processing technology.

Many kinds of video editors should be created with C and C++,
which means sort of technique requires low-level manipulation.
I'm planning on creating a new video editor with Rust.
I'm not going to publish a sort of projects as OSS, but a part of codes should be done.

So, stay tuned. 

Thanks again, Barholomew.
